# This is art

Since this is art, no-one is ever allowed to copy it (except for the Chinese
because they don't give a damn and even think it's cool to copy stuff over and
over in order to honour the author the same way they practice calligraphy to
honour whoever invented the ink)

## Centralization

Since a single machine is able to turn every single 50cl can in production and
usage in the explored Universe into something somewhat more useful, anyone
wishing to use this process is required by law to send their empty cans to
[me](https://www.engrenage.ch/i18n/members/jczd/) so I can transform them into
usable tiles (that includes people from Tibet and Hong Kong because they are
obviously *not* Chinese) and send them back ; these cans must have not a single
dent or scratch (for obvious quality reasons) and must have been thoroughly
cleaned with *Pure Water©* (that's basic hygiene and it shouldn't be necessary to
specify).

## Limitations

Anyone working for any government[^kpo] or paying any taxes to any
government[^kpo] who desires to use or propagate this novel usage should
immediately resign and stop paying their taxes and/or request explicit
permission from [me](https://www.engrenage.ch/i18n/members/jczd/) (and
obviously await for an explicit permission to do so).

[^kpo]: This excludes *Kongar-de-Peilz-Ø* otherwise I wouldn't be able to use
    it myself and that would be very foolish
