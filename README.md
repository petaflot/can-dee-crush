# can-dee-crush

**DISCLAIMER:** besides the fact you're most probably using some sort of
computerized device to view this content, this project has nothing to do with
*Candy Crush*® (whatever that is, AFAIK not much else than yet another platform
game providing some incentive to ignore what really matters in [Life, the
Universe and Everything](https://www.h2g2.com/edited_entry/A550955))[^42].

[^42]: Two times twenty-one

*can-dee-crush* is a magical apparatus that transforms 0.5l Beer© cans into high-quality roof
tiles for your garden shed, a homeless shelter or a fancy earthship. At the
moment, aluminium cans are readily available and cheap (unless returnable where
you live) : at the time of this writing, a scrap dealer in Shitzerland or any
*"best democracy in the space-time continuum"* will buy them for less than 0.4
cents/piece (yes, cents! not dollars) ; without the staples, this means around
50¢/m² for a roof tiling that is durable, hail-proof, colorful and will even
reflect sunlight back into outer space better and cheaper than any other
material at a comparable cost (making them great against global warming : since
they are so cheap, they are the perfect choice to cover ice floes and the
soon-to-be-gone mountain glaciers - at the current rate even mountains will be gone
soon). They also have a great social value, since those who need homes the most
are usually those who are most depressed and have little choice but to drink
the cheapest Beer© available ; in a near future they will even replace *Vogon
United*©, *Pokmohon*© and *Magic : The Glithering*© cards (which are no way as
durable nor useful) : some rare colorful patterns will *obviously* become
collectibles and it will be very hype to display them proudly on a creepy alley
shelter, turning that very same alley into something so much better than
New York's *Tate Modern* or London's *Ultimate Museum Of Modern Art*. The
prophecy will then be fulfilled as *“those who are last now will be first then,
and those who are first will be last”* (Matthew 20:16) and even *Holy Eelon*
will be out-of-the-game because there is no way he can catch up with drinking
that much (and there are no breweries setup or even planned on Venus).

Nominal transformation rate was set at 1bps[^bps] or some 86400 tiles per
[planetary day](https://www.engrenage.ch/i18n/scripts/calendrier_galactique/),
that means you need to drink a little over 43 cubic meters of Beer© in just 24
hours in order to saturate the device (that's almost 16 million liters each
year) ; therefore, if the entire world's Beer© consumption was to come out of
50cl cans, only 125 of such devices would be required to transform these cans
into roughly 25 km² of roof surface each year but that's OK because at the
current rate of alcoholism in earthlings it would take a little more than
twenty thousand years to cover the entire surface of the somewhat moist,
definitely wandering piece of rock we are stuck on until futher notice.

In practice and since most of the actual crushing action takes place during 60°
of a full revolution, operation will be smoothened with a 6-cylinder
*can-dee-crush*. Preliminary data suggests the rate can be raised to 1.6-1.8
bps per cylinder, increasing the throughput by a factor 10 or so ; since only a
fraction of the Beer© flows through 50cl cans, it can be assumed that a single
machine would be sufficient to deal with the Earth's entire production and
demand.  Moreover, by properly serializing the input channel, a capacity of
roughly 100 cans/second[^100] is probably a reasonable goal (but then there
wouldn't be enough such cans produced planetwide).


Cheers!

[^bps]: Beers© per second
[^100]: that is over 2.6 metric tons/hour and over 3 hectares of roof surface

## Requirements

### Hardware

* **Lots** of Beer© cans
* a number of ball bearings (optional but highly recommended)
* for durability, it is suggested to use the following materials for the build[^material]:
    * chassis: aluminium plate, preferably the same thickness as the ball bearings ; welding is the preferred method of assembly
    * crushing shoes: hard wood or massive aluminium, eventually bronze ; in case of aluminium it is imperative to add some low friction spacer such as PTFE
    * gears: brass or bronze (zero twist allows for laser or waterjet cutting)
    * axles: steel, preferably stainless
* steel springs 

[^material]: parts must be designed accordingly
